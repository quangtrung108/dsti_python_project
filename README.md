# DSTI - Python project group

# This project focuses on cybersecurity data analysis, specifically preparing a network attack log for machine learning applications. The goal is to analyze network traffic, identify attack patterns, and develop models to detect anomalies or malicious activity.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning and analyzing network logs.

🔍 Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features for model training.

🤖 Machine Learning Modeling: Building models to classify network attacks.

💻 Streamlit App: A web interface for visualizing attack data and model predictions.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1.  Install the required Python libraries by running :

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run EDA Notebook

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ./EDA+ML/Cybersecurity_Analysis_Modeling-1.ipynb

## 🚀 Run the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Install Streamlit (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit

2. Navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located.


3. Run the app with the following command
    
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

4. The app will open automatically in your default browser at http://localhost:8501. If not, open it manually.
